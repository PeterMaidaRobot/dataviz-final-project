# Data Visualization Project

## Data

This data shows the number of deaths by suicide, firearms, and alcohol based on age group, race, and sex.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What ages have the highest suicide rates?
 * What ethnicities have the highest suicide rates?
 * What ages have the highest firearm deaths?
 * What ethnicities have the highest firearm deaths?
 * What ages have the highest alchol-related deaths?
 * What ethnicities have the highest alchol-related deaths?
 * How does sex relate to the type of death (firearm, alchol, suicide)?
 * How do these trends change over time? Do death rates go up or down for certain groups?


## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

I am unsure of the most interesting and efficient way to describe all of this data at once.
