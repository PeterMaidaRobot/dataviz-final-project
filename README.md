# Data Visualization Project

## Data

This data shows the number of deaths by suicide, firearms, and alcohol based on age group, race, and sex.

[Suicide Deaths by Age, Race, and Sex](https://data.world/healthdatany/j6fz-a4ta/workspace/file?filename=vital-statistics-suicide-deaths-by-age-group-race-ethnicity-resident-county-region-and-gender-beginn-1.csv)


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar graph and it shows the number of firearm deaths over time, split among sex.

I've also created a stacked bar/"line" graph that shows the numbers of deaths over time broken down by each cause.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What ages have the highest suicide rates?
 * What ethnicities have the highest suicide rates?
 * What ages have the highest firearm deaths?
 * What ethnicities have the highest firearm deaths?
 * What ages have the highest alchol-related deaths?
 * What ethnicities have the highest alchol-related deaths?
 * How does sex relate to the type of death (firearm, alchol, suicide)?
 * How do these trends change over time? Do death rates go up or down for certain groups?


## Sketches

On the top of this sketch, we can see the amount of deaths over time, along with the breakdown into various categories.
On the bottom of this sketch, we can see donut chart breakdowns across various groups.


## Open Questions

I am unsure of the most interesting and efficient way to describe all of this data at once.
